Food and Drinks near DOD ATX
============================

So if you're in Austin for a few days for DevOps Days ATX and want some tips on where to eat...  I'm not posting locations or hours or anything,  you've got a google.   Be aware though a lot of places are closed on mondays.

Barbecue
--------

Texas barbecue is all about the brisket.  The best way to eat it is to order 'Moist outside cut' but if you don't like fatty meat go for lean.  Here's some great options :

* Rudy's -  This is a local chain.  If you've never eaten Texas BBQ before this is probably the place to go.  It's the IBM of BBQ,  nobody ever got fired for buying it.   Tell them its your first time and they'll carry on like a pork chop for a few minutes to embarrass you and then proceed to give you a little of each item to taste.   The creamed corn here is where its at.

* Franklin BBQ - Arguably the best Texas style BBQ in the world.  but is it worth a 4-5 hour wait ?  Let us know if you brave the lines.

* Stileswitch - Pretty good barbecue here,  fairly close to the Marchesa so definitely worth a mention.

* LA BBQ - Great BBQ,  almost as good as Franklin,  no 4 hour lines.

* Freedman's - great high end BBQ, good whiskey selection.

Mexican
-------

* Taco More - Not far from the venue,  has a great spicy goat soup and a solid salsa bar ( the onions covered in spicy red oil from the salsa bar are great ).

* La Fruta de Feliz - My favorite for breakfast after a big night,  a great select of fresh made hangover curing juices and some great Mexican comfort food.  I highly recommend the chilaquiles ( green sauce ) with a couple of breakfast tacos.  The Tripas ( fried stomach lining ) Taco is my favorite, but its not for everyone.  They also make a great Menudo ( tripe soup ) and also have some good goat options.

Tex-Mex
-------

* Chuy's is a local chain that IPO'd and now has restaurants all over the country.   It's the Rudy's of texmex.  Good cheap food.

* Taco Deli - hipster tacos that actually taste great.   don't go at peak meal times unless you want to wait 30mins in line.

* Torchy's Tacos - agains, some great tasting pseudo-hipster tacos.  They have some great standard options as well as monthly specials... you just missed the Roscoe ( chicken and waffles taco )

Japanese / Sushi
----------------

Austin has a surprisingly good selection of Japanese/Sushi restaurants.  Here's my picks:

* Kome -  right near the venue,  not the best on the list, but very solid.  Lots more than just sushi too.

* Hanabi - also close to the venue,  the best sushi within a few miles.

* Uchi/Uchiko - Uchiko is farily close,  Uchi is a fair hike.   Uchi is more traditional sushi where uchiko is more japanese farm house food.  Both are in the top 5 restaurants in austin and have killer desserts and hipster friendly brussel sprouts.

* Soto - If you find yourself in the far north this place great,  almost as good as uchi/uchiko.  They have Fois Gras Sushimi, enough said.

* Michi Ramen - Great Ramen for lunch,  if dinner go to tatu-ya

* Ramen Tatsu-ya - Great Ramen for dinner,  if lunch go to Michi


Beer
----

* Black Star Co-op -   Typical venue for austin #beerops.   Great inhouse brewed beers as well as outside stuff.  Solid food as well.  They pay their staff a living wage and don't accept tips.  

* Pinthouse Pizza - Great inhouse brewed beers and pretty solid pizza

* Easy Tiger - great beer garden downtown.  Drink some beers with some house made sausage and giant pretzels

* Hops & Grains - not a pub but they have a great tasting room that's open most days.

* gourdough's public house - Great Pub with amazing beers and ridiculous donuts.

Comfort Food
------------

* Southerns @ PBK - not only are they catering lunch but they have a great location in far north austin ( technically pflugerville ).  try house made tater tots and the rootbeer and whiskey float.

* Hoovers - pretty good southern comfort food.   

* Threadgills - like hoovers

* Catfish Parlour - if you're into fried bottom feeders

Asian
-----

anything not japanese is getting lumped together here ... sorry.

* Baguette House - great Vietnamese Bahn Mi,  this is in a cluster of asian restaurants and stores so well worth checking out what else is nearby.

* Tahn My - Solid Pho not far from the venue

* Rice Bowl Cafe - a little north but great Tawainese food.  3cup chicken is great here,  A few doors up is Snowmonster which is a great tawainese shaved ice for dessert

* Kin and Komfort - also a little north,  amazing fusion of Thai and Southern food out of a foodcourt.  Cash only.   Try the grandmothers deviled eggs and the beef tongue salad.

MEAT!!!!
--------

* Dai Due -  A great new restaurant and butchershop in Austin.   Can't recommend it highly enough.

* Salt and Time - Similar to Dai Due,  some great beers and great meat.  good sandwhiches for lunch and a great selection of house made charcuterie.  Their Butcher's burger is killer.

* Salty Sow - pig related, nose to tail sensibilities.

* Bacon - Yes, its really called Bacon.  Do I really need to say anything else ?

The Good stuff
--------------

* Barley Swine -  Probably the best restaurant in Austin.  It's usually busy and has communal tables.  

* Foreign and Domestic - My favorite restaurant in ATX and pretty close to the venue.  Dollar Oysters on tuesdays.

* Odd Duck - same chef as Barley Swine,  but I prefer BS.

Burgers
-------

We have a few in-n-outs, a couple of 5guys,  but here's some good local places :

* Hopdoddy - if you're wearing a white belt, have a long beard and a raging desire to drop $30 on a burger and drink this is your home.

* Top Notch - Great charcoal grilled burgers,  was in the movie 'Dazed and Confused'.  alright alright alright.

* Mighty Fine - Same family as Rudy's BBQ.  Solid burgers, good fries.   They do have a somewhat secret menu,  Order the lemonade shake,  it's like a liquid lemon cheesecake.
